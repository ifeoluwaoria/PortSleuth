# PortSleuth - Simple Python Port Scanner

PortSleuth is a lightweight Python 3 script for scanning TCP ports on a target host. Itâ€™s designed for learning and cybersecurity practice, allowing you to check which ports are open or closed on a given IP or hostname.

## Features

- Scan single ports, multiple ports, or a range of ports.
- Default scan includes ports 80 and 443.
- Simple output indicating **OPEN** or **CLOSED/filtered** ports.
- Easy to run with Python 3.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ifeoluwaoria/PortSleuth.git

2) Ensure you have Python 3 installed:
python3 --version

3) Usage
python3 portsleuth.py <target> [-p PORTS]

<target>: IP address or hostname you want to scan.
